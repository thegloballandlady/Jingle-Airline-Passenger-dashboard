# Jingle Airline Passenger Dataset Analysis
---



### Project Overview
---
This project analyzes Jingle Airline's passenger data spanning 1949 to 1960. The dataset consists of 144 records, detailing monthly passenger counts. After cleaning the data in Excel, Power BI was used for transformation and creating insightful visualizations. The goal is to explore trends, seasonal patterns, and growth rates, providing valuable insights into passenger behavior over the years.


### Dataset Details
---
The dataset includes the following columns:

* Date: Monthly dates from 1949 to 1960.
* Passengers: Number of passengers recorded each month.



### Data Cleaning and Transformation
---
1. Excel
* Corrected date formatting for consistency.
* Removed duplicates and filled missing values, ensuring data integrity.

2. Power BI:
* Transformed the dataset to include derived columns like year, quarter, and month.
* Aggregated metrics for deeper analysis and visualization.



### Dashboards and Visualizations
---
The following key insights and metrics were visualized in Power BI:

1. Yearly Passenger Growth Rate
* Displays the percentage increase in total passengers from one year to the next, showing long-term growth trends.

2. Monthly Passenger Growth Rate for Each Year
* Highlights the month-to-month changes within each year, uncovering seasonal patterns and fluctuations.

3. Minimum Passengers by Quarter
* Identifies quarters with the lowest passenger counts, useful for resource planning and analysis of demand cyclesTotal Passenger Count

4. Aggregates the total number of passengers over the entire dataset, providing a comprehensive view of overall growth.

5. Minimum Passengers Yearly
* Displays the year with the lowest recorded passenger count, identifying periods of low demand or anomalies.


### Tools Used
---
* Excel: Data cleaning and preparation
* Power BI: Data transformation, dashboard creation, and visualization



### Key Insights
---
* Yearly Growth Trends: The data revealed consistent passenger growth over the years, except for occasional dips attributed to external factors.
* Seasonal Patterns: Monthly growth rates highlighted peak travel periods and low-demand seasons, valuable for operational planning.
* Quarterly and Annual Lows: Identifying quarters and years with minimum passenger counts helps assess challenges and improve strategies.
